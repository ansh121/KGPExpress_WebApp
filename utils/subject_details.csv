It will also focus on the practicalaspects of communication in the professional contexts. 1.Communication skills:definition and practical dimensions 2.Communication in the contemporary world:Communication and technology3.Communication in workplaces4.Ethical dimensionsof communication 5.

A significant instance of this process ofmeaning-making would be the creative use of language by a litterateur and thecreative reception of a literary text by the intelligent and imaginativereader. When the students read literary texts and give critical responses tothem they are enabled to formulate and express their thoughts in a concreteway, which is one of the basic requirements for genuinely effectivecommunication. Literary texts also familiarize them with the ways peoplecommunicate with each other in the real world - this enhances the communicationskills of the learners in an indirect but very fruitful way. 1.Examples ofculture-specific use of language and their implications:  ﬁIndian Englishﬂpoems2.Is there any absolute standard for speaking good English? Œ Views ofgreat writers3.Rhetorical force and persuasive power of poetic utterances:Relevant texts4.Spiritual communication: Instances of spiritual literature5.Thepower of language: Critical perspectives from world literature           [Thetexts/web-links to the texts will be provided to the students] I.Language LabActivitiesThe following topics would be taught in the language lab classes inan interactive way, involving the students in a creative process of learningthe English language.
